BASIC DATA STRUCTURE FOR ARRAY :
--------------------------------

Custom Array Class Implementation in Python
-------------------------------------------

class Array:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity  # Maximum size of the array
        self.size = 0  # Current number of elements in the array
        self.data = [None] * capacity  # Allocate memory for the array elements
    
    def __str__(self):
        # String representation to show current elements in the array
        return str([self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)])

# Create an array of size 5
arr = Array(5)
print(arr)

EXPLANATION :
-------------

This implementation represents a static array. The capacity of the array is fixed at the time of creation (in this case, 5), and you can't change its size dynamically after it has been created. If you need to add more elements than the defined capacity, you would have to create a new array with a larger capacity and copy the existing elements over.

In contrast, a dynamic array would allow for resizing as needed, typically through methods that manage the addition and removal of elements while adjusting the underlying storage.

1. Class Definition:
--------------------

class Array: This defines a new class called Array. A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects (instances), which can have attributes (data) and methods (functions).

2. Constructor Method: def __init__(self, capacity):
----------------------------------------------------

__init__ is a special method in Python called the constructor. It is automatically called when a new object (instance) of the class is created.
self: This is a reference to the current instance of the class. It allows you to bind attributes to the specific instance.
capacity: This is an argument that defines the maximum size (capacity) of the array. When creating an Array instance, you will provide this value (like Array(5)).

3. Setting Attributes: self.capacity = capacity
 ------------------------------------------------
 self.capacity: This creates an attribute named capacity for the instance, which stores the value passed when creating the object.
The capacity parameter is passed in the constructor, and self.capacity binds it to the instance.

self.size = 0
self.size: This creates an attribute called size for the instance and initializes it to 0. This size will track the current number of elements in the array.
Initially, the array is empty, so its size is set to 0.

self.data = [None] * capacity
self.data: This creates an attribute data that will hold the array elements.
[None] * capacity: This creates a list of None values with the length equal to the capacity. For example, if capacity is 5, it will create a list [None, None, None, None, None], which represents the empty array where elements can later be added.
Essentially, this allocates memory for the array but doesn't store any actual values yet (since None just acts as a placeholder).

4. String Representation Method: def __str__(self):
---------------------------------------------------
This is a special method called __str__, which is used to define how the object should be represented as a string when printed.
When you call print(arr), Python looks for this __str__ method and uses it to convert the object into a human-readable string.

return str([self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)])

This returns a string representation of the array's current elements.
[self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)]: This is a list comprehension that loops through the array from index 0 up to self.size - 1, collecting the current elements that have been added (ignoring the None placeholders).
range(self.size): Generates a range from 0 to size-1, so it only includes the actual elements, not the None values.
self.data[i]: Retrieves the element at position i in the array.
str(...): Converts the list of actual elements into a string format so it can be printed. For example, if there are two elements 10 and 20 in the array, it would return "[10, 20]".

arr = Array(5)

This creates a new instance of the Array class with a capacity of 5. The constructor __init__ is automatically called with capacity=5.
self.capacity will be set to 5.
self.size will be initialized to 0.
self.data will be initialized as [None, None, None, None, None], reserving space for 5 elements.

 6. Printing the Array Object: print(arr)
-------------------------------------------
This will call the __str__ method to get the string representation of the array.
Since no elements have been added yet (self.size = 0), the array is still empty. The __str__ method will return "[]", representing an empty array.

Full Explanation of Code Workflow :
-----------------------------------
Define Class    :   The Array class is defined with an initialization method (__init__) and a string representation method (__str__).
Create Object   :   When arr = Array(5) is called, an instance of Array is created with a capacity of 5.
Allocate Memory :   In the constructor, memory is allocated for 5 elements (self.data = [None, None, None, None, None]), and the current size is set to 0 (self.size = 0).
Print Object    :   When print(arr) is executed, Python calls the __str__ method, which returns the string representation of the current array (empty at this point), and prints [].




# Step 2: Accessing Elements
----------------------------
class Array:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.size = 0
        self.data = [None] * capacity
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str([self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)])
    
    def access(self, index):
        if index >= 0 and index < self.size:
            return self.data[index]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")

# Create an array and test element access
arr = Array(5)
arr.data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  # Manually adding data for testing
arr.size = 5  # Update the size manually
print(arr.access(2))  # Output should be 30

Explanation:
The access method takes an index and returns the element at that index if it's within bounds.


Step 3: Insertion
-----------------
Now, let's create a method to insert elements. We'll handle insertions at the end of the array, beginning, or any specific position.


class Array:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.size = 0
        self.data = [None] * capacity
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str([self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)])
    
    def access(self, index):
        if index >= 0 and index < self.size:
            return self.data[index]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
    
    def insert(self, index, value):
        if self.size >= self.capacity:
            raise OverflowError("Array is full")
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            raise IndexError("Invalid index")
        
        # Shift elements to the right
        for i in range(self.size, index, -1):
            self.data[i] = self.data[i - 1]
        
        # Insert the new value
        self.data[index] = value
        self.size += 1

# Create an array and test insertion
arr = Array(5)
arr.insert(0, 10)  # Insert 10 at index 0
arr.insert(1, 20)  # Insert 20 at index 1
arr.insert(1, 15)  # Insert 15 at index 1 (shifting 20 to the right)
print(arr)  # Output should be [10, 15, 20]


Explanation:
------------
The insert method takes an index and value, and shifts the elements to the right to make room for the new element.
If the array is full (size >= capacity), we raise an OverflowError.


Step 4: Deletion
-----------------
We'll now implement a method to delete elements from the array.

class Array:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.size = 0
        self.data = [None] * capacity
    
    def __str__(self):
        return str([self.data[i] for i in range(self.size)])
    
    def access(self, index):
        if index >= 0 and index < self.size:
            return self.data[index]
        else:
            raise IndexError("Index out of bounds")
    
    def insert(self, index, value):
        if self.size >= self.capacity:
            raise OverflowError("Array is full")
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            raise IndexError("Invalid index")
        
        for i in range(self.size, index, -1):
            self.data[i] = self.data[i - 1]
        self.data[index] = value
        self.size += 1
    
    def delete(self, index):
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            raise IndexError("Invalid index")
        
        # Shift elements to the left
        for i in range(index, self.size - 1):
            self.data[i] = self.data[i + 1]
        
        # Nullify the last element
        self.data[self.size - 1] = None
        self.size -= 1

# Create an array and test deletion
arr = Array(5)
arr.insert(0, 10)
arr.insert(1, 20)
arr.insert(2, 30)
arr.insert(3, 40)
print(arr)  # Output should be [10, 20, 30, 40]
arr.delete(2)  # Delete the element at index 2
print(arr)  # Output should be [10, 20, 40]


Explanation:
------------
The delete method removes the element at the specified index and shifts the remaining elements to the left.


Step 5: Traversal
-------------------
Traversing simply means going through the elements of the array one by one.

def traverse(self):
    for i in range(self.size):
        print(self.data[i])

# Test traversal
arr.traverse()  # Output: 10 20 40


Step 6: Searching
--------------------
We’ll implement both linear search and binary search for sorted arrays.

def linear_search(self, value):
    for i in range(self.size):
        if self.data[i] == value:
            return i
    return -1



Binary Search (for sorted arrays):
----------------------------------

def binary_search(self, value):
    low = 0
    high = self.size - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if self.data[mid] == value:
            return mid
        elif self.data[mid] < value:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

Explaination :
--------------
Function Definition:

def binary_search(self, value):

self: This indicates the function is part of a class, and self refers to the instance of the class that is calling this method. This is typical in object-oriented programming.
value: This is the target value we want to find in the array.

Variables Initialization:

low = 0
high = self.size - 1


low: The starting index of the array. Initially, we set it to 0 (the first element).
high: The ending index of the array. Initially, it's set to self.size - 1, which is the last index of the array (self.size is the total number of elements).


while low <= high:


This loop runs as long as the low index is less than or equal to the high index. It ensures that there are still elements to search in the array. When low becomes greater than high, it means the value isn’t in the array.


Mid Calculation:

mid = (low + high) // 2

mid: This represents the middle index of the current search range. We calculate it by averaging low and high. The // operator performs integer division (floors the result if it’s a decimal).
For example, if low = 0 and high = 9, mid = (0 + 9) // 2 = 4. The element at index 4 is the midpoint of the array.

Comparison Logic:

Case 1: Value Found

if self.data[mid] == value:
    return mid

Here, we check if the element at the mid index is equal to the target value.
If it is, we return the mid index, as we've found the target value.

Case 2: Search in the Right Half

elif self.data[mid] < value:
    low = mid + 1

If the middle element (self.data[mid]) is less than the target value, this means the target value must be in the right half of the current range.
We update the low index to mid + 1 because any element to the left of mid (including mid itself) can be ignored from the search. The new search space is between mid + 1 and high.

Case 3: Search in the Left Half

else:
    high = mid - 1

If the middle element (self.data[mid]) is greater than the target value, this means the target value must be in the left half of the current range.
We update the high index to mid - 1 because any element to the right of mid (including mid itself) can be ignored from the search. The new search space is between low and mid - 1.

Return Value:

return -1

If the while loop finishes without finding the target value, it means the value is not in the array, so the function returns -1 to indicate failure.
Visualizing the Process:
Imagine we have the sorted array [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13] and we are searching for the value 9.

First Iteration:

low = 0, high = 6
mid = (0 + 6) // 2 = 3
self.data[mid] = 7, which is less than 9
We update low = mid + 1 = 4 (Now we search in the right half).
Second Iteration:

low = 4, high = 6
mid = (4 + 6) // 2 = 5
self.data[mid] = 11, which is greater than 9
We update high = mid - 1 = 4 (Now we search in the left half).
Third Iteration:

low = 4, high = 4
mid = (4 + 4) // 2 = 4
self.data[mid] = 9, which is equal to 9
We return mid = 4.
Time Complexity:
Best Case: O(1) – The target value is found at the middle index on the first try.
Worst Case: O(log n) – In each iteration, the size of the search range is halved, so the time complexity is logarithmic with respect to the number of elements in the array (n).
Key Points:
Binary search only works on sorted arrays.
It eliminates half the search space in each iteration, making it much more efficient than a linear search (which checks each element one by one).
